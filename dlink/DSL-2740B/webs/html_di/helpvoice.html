domain name with the SIP number in the SIP
messages that it sends. Select TEL-URL to have
the router use the SIP number without a domain
name in the SIP messages that it send.</dd>
			<dt>User Parameter</dt><dd>You can set this to phone or none. This
determines whether or not the phone number is
appended to the information forwarded to your SIP
server. Your VoIP service provider will instruct you
which setting to use.</dd>
			<dt>Initial Unregister</dt><dd>You can set this to enabled or disabled. Some
SIP servers can become unstable if you are
registered more than once (due to a power outage
and subsequent reboot of the router, for example).
This setting allows your router to ¡°unregister¡± itself
when it is rebooted, removing the previously sent
registration information.</dd>

before sending a repeat registration request if a
registration attempt fails or there is no response
from the registration server.</dd>
			<dt>Session Expires</dt><dd>This field will set the longest time that the router
will allow a SIP session to remain idle (without
traffic) before dropping it.</dd>
			<dt>Min-SE</dt><dd>When two SIP devices negotiate a SIP session, they
must negotiate a common expiration time for idle
SIP sessions. This field sets the shortest expiration
time that the router will accept. The router checks
the session expiration values of incoming SIP
INVITE requests against the minimum session
expiration value that you enter here. If the session
expiration of an incoming INVITE request is less
than this value, the router negotiates with the other
SIP device to increase the session expiration value
to match the minimum session expiration value.</dd>
			<dt>Session Expires Refresher</dt><dd>This determines which side of an expired call
session will initiate the session refresh. uac -
specifies the Caller side will initiate the session
refresh. uas - specifies the Call receiver (the
"Callee") will initiate the session refresh.</dd>

your VoIP service provider uses. Select Enabled
(RFC 2833) to send the DTMF tones in RTP

not use compression (like G.711).</dd>
<dt>Payload Type</dt><dd>A Payload Type is a number from 96 through 127

a fax payload. This field is only active when the

It is recommended to leave these in their default

used in conjunction with the specific codec. It is not
recommended that you change this unless specified
via your VoIP Service Provider.</dd>

               <DD>Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a standard for easy and secure establishment of a wireless home network.
               The goal of the WPS protocol is to simplify the process of configuring security on wireless networks, and so it was first named 'Wi-Fi Simple Config'(WSC). 
               You can connect easily and securely a wireless network by simply inputting a pin or push a button.

			  <DT>WEP 
              <DD>
              <P>A method of encrypting data for wireless communication intended 
              to provide the same level of privacy as a wired network. WEP is 
              not as secure as WPA encryption. To gain access to a WEP network, 
              you must know the key. The key is a string of characters that you 
              create. When using WEP, you must determine the level of 
              encryption. The type of encryption determines the key length. 
              128-bit encryption requires a longer key than 64-bit encryption. 
              Keys are defined by entering in a string in HEX (hexadecimal - 
              using characters 0-9, A-F) or ASCII (American Standard Code for 
              Information Interchange - alphanumeric characters) format. ASCII 
              format is provided so you can enter a string that is easier to 
              remember. The ASCII string is converted to HEX for use over the 
              network. Four keys can be defined so that you can change keys 
              easily. </P>

                encryption.) 
                <DD>128-bit hexadecimal keys are exactly 26 characters in 
                length. (456FBCDF123400122225271730 is a valid string of 26 
                characters for 128-bit encryption.) 
                <DD>64-bit ASCII keys are up to 5 characters in length (DMODE is

			  <DD>WEP encryption is enabled and encryption key strength of 64-bit or 128-bit needs to be selected.  
			  Click on Set Encryption Keys to manually set the network encryption keys.  
			  Up to 4 different keys can be set and you can come back to select which one to use at anytime.
			  <DT>802.1X
			  <DD>This requires mutual authentication between a client station and the router by including a 
			  RADIUS-based authentication server.  Information about the RADIUS server such as its IP address, 
			  port and key must be entered.
			  <DT>WPA
			  <DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access)- usually used for the larger Enterprise environment, 
			  it uses a RADIUS server and TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) encryption 
			  (instead of WEP encryption which is disabled).  
			  TKIP uses 128-bit dynamic session keys (per user, per session, and per packet keys).
			  <DT>WPA-PSK 
			  <DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access - Pre-Shared Key)- WPA for home and SOHO environments also using the same 
		      strong TKIP encryption, per-packet key construction, and key management that WPA provides in the 
			  enterprise environment.  The main difference is that the password is entered manually.  
			  A group re-key interval time is also required.
			  <DT>WPA2 
			  <DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)- second generation of WPA which uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) 
			  instead of TKIP as its encryption method.  Network re-auth interval is the time in which another key 
			  needs to be dynamically issued. 
			  <DT>WPA2-PSK 
			  <DD>(Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 - Pre-Shared Key)- suitable for home and SOHO environments, it also uses 
			  AES encryption and requires you to enter a password and an re-key interval time.
			  <DT>Mixed WPA2/WPA 
			  <DD>During transitional times for upgrades in the enterprise environment, this mixed authentication 
			  method allows "upgraded" and users not yet "upgraded" to access the network via the router.  
			  RADIUS server information must be entered for WPA and a as well as a group re-key interval time.  
			  Both TKIP and AES are used.
			  <DT>Mixed WPA2/WPA-PSK
			  <DD>This is useful during transitional times for upgrades in the home or SOHO environment, 
			  a pre-shared key must be entered along with the group re-key interval time.  
			  Both TKIP and AES are also used.
			  <P><b>Group Key Interval: </b>The amount 
              of time before the group key used for broadcast and multicast data 
              is changed. </P>

                  From 192.168.1.100 To 192.168.1.199. This means that 
                  192.168.1.3 to 192.168.1.99 and 192.168.1.200 to 192.168.1.254 
                  are NOT managed by the DHCP Server. Computers or devices that

                DSL providers typically use this option. 
                This method of connection requires you to enter a Username and Password (provided by your Internet Service Provider) to gain access to the IPv6 Internet. 
                The supported authentication protocols are PAP and CHAP. 

           		<DL>
                <DT>Dynamic IP:
                <DD>Select this option if the ISP's servers assign the router's WAN IPv6 address upon establishing a connection. 
                <DT>Static IP: 
                <DD>If your ISP has assigned a fixed IPv6 address, select this option. The ISP provides the value for the IPv6 Address. 
                <DT>Service Name: 
                <DD>Some ISP's may require that you enter a Service Name. Only enter a Service Name if your ISP requires one. 
                <DT>Maximum Idle Time: 
                <DD>The time interval the machine can be idle before the WAN link is disconnected. The Maximum Idle Time value is only used for the "On demand" and "Manual" reconnect modes. 
                </DL> 
                
                <DT>LAN IPv6 ADDRESS SETTINGS
                <DD>These are the settings of the LAN (Local Area Network) IPv6 interface for the router. 
                The router's LAN IPv6 Address configuration is based on the IPv6 Address and Subnet assigned by your ISP. 
                (A subnet with prefix /64 is supported in LAN.) 
                <DT>LAN ADDRESS AUTOCONFIGURATION SETTINGS 
                <DD>Use this section to set up IPv6 Autoconfiguration to assign an IPv6 address to the computers on your local network. 
                A Stateless and a Stateful Autoconfiguration method are provided. 
                <DL>

                <DT>Enable Autoconfiguration 
                <DD>These two values (from and to) define a range of IPv6 addresses that the DHCPv6 Server uses when assigning addresses to computers and devices on your Local Area Network. 
                Any addresses that are outside this range are not managed by the DHCPv6 Server. 
                However, these could be used for manually configuring devices or devices that cannot use DHCPv6 to automatically obtain network address details. 
                <DD>When you select Stateful (DHCPv6), the following options are displayed. 
                <DD>The computers (and other devices) connected to your LAN also need to have their TCP/IP configuration set to "DHCPv6" or "Obtain an IPv6 address automatically". 
                <DT>IPv6 Address Range (DHCPv6) 
                <DD>Once your D-Link router is properly configured and this option is enabled, 
                the router will manage the IPv6 addresses and other network configuration information for computers and other devices connected to your Local Area Network. There is no need for you to do this yourself. 
                <DD>It is possible for a computer or device that is manually configured to have an IPv6 address that does reside within this range. 
                <DT>IPv6 Address Lifetime 
                <DD>The amount of time that a computer may have an IPv6 address before it is required to renew the lease.

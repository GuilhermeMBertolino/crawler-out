						<DT>AP Isolation
						<DD>if you select enable, then each of your wireless clients will not be able to communicate with each other.
						<DT>Band
						<DD>A default setting at 2.4GHz - 802.11g
						<DT>Channel
						<DD>802.11b and 802.11g use channels to limit interference from other devices. If you are experiencing interference with another 2.4Ghz device such as a baby monitor, security alarm, or cordless phone, then change the channel on your router.
						<DT>54gTM Rate
						<DD>The wireless link rate at which information will be received and transmitted on your wireless network.
						<DT>Multicast Rate
						<DD>The rate at which a message is sent to a specified group of recipients.
						<DT>Basic Rate
						<DD>The set of data transfer rates that all the stations will be capable of using to receive frames from a wireless medium.
						<DT>Fragmentation Threshold
						<DD>Used to fragment packets which help improve performance in the presence of radio frequency (RF) interference.
						<DT>RTS Threshold (Request to Send Threshold)
						<DD>determines the packet size of a transmission through the use of the router to help control traffic flow. 
						<DT>DTIM Interval
						<DD>DTIM interval, also known as a Data Beacon Rate, is the frequency at which an access point's beacon will include a DTIM. This frequency is usually measured in milliseconds (ms) or its equivalent, kilomicroseconds (Kmsec).
						<DT>Beacon Interval
						<DD>A packet of information that is sent from a connected device to all other devices where it announces its availability and readiness. A beacon interval is a period of time (sent with the beacon) before sending the beacon again. The beacon interval may be adjusted in milliseconds (ms).
						<DT>Xpress Technology
						<DD>A technology that utilizes standards based on framebursting to achieve higher throughput. With Xpress Technology enabled, aggregate throughput (the sum of the individual throughput speeds of each client on the network) can improve by up to 25% in 802.11g only networks and up to 75% in mixed networks comprised of 802.11g and 802.11b device.
						<DT>54g Mode
						<DD>54g is Broadcom's standards-based 802.11g technology, with maximum performance speed, reach, security, and ease of use.
						<DT>54g Protection
						<DD>The 802.11g standards provide a protection method so 802.11g and 802.11b devices can co-exist in the same network without "speaking" at the same time.  Do not disable 54g Protection if there is a possibility that a 802.11b device may need to use your wireless network.  In Auto Mode, the wireless device will use RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send) to improve 802.11g performance in mixed 802.11g/802.11b networks. Turn protection off to maximize 802.11g throughput under most conditions.
						<DT>Preamble Type
						<DD>This is the length of the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) block for communication between the router and wireless clients. High network traffic areas should select Short preamble type.  
						<DT>Transmit Power
						<DD>This is the percentage of power that should be transmitted from your wireless router.  Select from 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.
						<DT>Mac Filter
						<DD>Mac address filter can help you to deny or allow the connection of wireless client. Without MAC address filtering, any wireless client can join the wireless network if they know the network name (also called the SSID) and perhaps a few other security parameters like encryption keys. When MAC address filtering is enabled, however, the access point or router performs an additional check on a different parameter.You can check "Disabled" option to prohibit the Mac filter funcion in the page. You alse can check the "Allow" option to allow the mac address in the mac address table to connect to your network, or check the "Deny" option to deny the connecting of mac address in the mac filter table to your network.

						<P>Port Triggering is a special form of Port Forwarding in which it requires an outgoing connection 
						before allowing incoming connections on a single or multiple port. Port Triggering is mostly used when 
						you computer is behind a NAT router.</P> <P>For example, in a gaming application 
						sends outgoing data on ports 5000-6000 but the recieves the incoming data on port 111, typically behind a NAT 
						router the router simply drops the data because it does not know which computer it should send requests to.
						But with port triggering you can tell the router to allow incoming data on port 111 when an outgoing data sends
						it through ports 5000-6000. It gives more flexibility than static port forwarding because you don't need
						to set it up for a specific computer.</P>

					<DT>Inbound/Outbound Filter
					<DD>
					<P>When you use the Port Triggering or Port Forwarding features to open specific ports to traffic from the 
					Internet, you could be increasing the exposure of your LAN to cyberattacks from the Internet. 
					In these cases, you can use Inbound Filters to limit that exposure by specifying the IP addresses of internet 
					hosts that you trust to access your LAN through the ports that you have opened. You might, for example, only 
					allow access to a game server on your home LAN from the computers of friends whom you have invited to play 
					the games on that server.</P>
					<P>Inbound Filters can be used for limiting access to a server on your network to a system or group of systems. 
					Filter rules can be used with Port Triggering features. Each filter can be used for several functions; 
					for example a "Game Clan" filter might allow all of the members of a particular gaming group to play several 
					different games for which gaming entries have been created. At the same time an "Admin" filter might only 
					allows systems from your office network to access the WAN admin pages and an FTP server you use at home. 
					If you add an IP address to a filter, the change is effected in all of the places where the filter is used.</P>
					<P>Outbound Filters can be used to limit LAN computer from accessing the internet. Filters can be used with 
					Port Forwarding features. Outbound filter can be used in conjuction with the Inbound Filter to allow incoming 
					and restrict outgoing access when playing a game over the internet or simply downloading a file.</p>
					<DT>Bridge Filter
					<DD>Also known as MAC address filter. You can forward or deny incoming traffic based on the source MAC address or
					the destination MAC address. Note that bridge filter will work with interfaces which are configured as bridge.

						networks for multimedia applications at home. For instance, you can map PVC1 to port 1~3 to 
						create a network(broadcast domain) for PCs toward Internet, and map PVC2 to port 4 to create

      Locking the wireless security settings prevents the settings from being changed by any new external registrar using its PIN. Devices can still be added to the wireless network using Wi-Fi Protected Setup. It is still possible to change wireless network settings with <a href="wirelesssetting.html">Manual Wireless Network Setup</a>, <a href="wlsecintro.html">Wireless Network Setup Wizard</a>, or an existing external WLAN Manager Registrar.    </td>

			  <DT>PIN Settings
			  <DD>A PIN is a unique number that can be used to add the router to an existing network or to create a new network. The default PIN may be printed on the bottom of the router. For extra security, a new PIN can be generated. You can restore the default PIN at any time. Only the Administrator ("admin" account) can change or reset the PIN.

        <b>Reset PIN to Default</b> <br>
        Restore the default PIN of the router. <br>
        <b>Generate New PIN</b> <br>
        Create a random number that is a valid PIN. This becomes the router's PIN. You can then copy this PIN to the user interface of the registrar.

              <DT>Add Wireless Station
              <DD>This Wizard helps you add wireless devices to the wireless network.<br>
The wizard will either display the wireless network settings to guide you through manual configuration, prompt you to enter the PIN for the device, or ask you to press the configuration button on the device. 
If the device supports Wi-Fi Protected Setup and has a configuration button, you can add it to the network by pressing the configuration button on the device and then the on the router within 60 seconds. 
The status LED on the router will flash three times if the device has been successfully added to the network.<br>
There are several ways to add a wireless device to your network. Access to the wireless network is controlled by a registrar.
 A registrar only allows devices onto the wireless network if you have entered the PIN, or pressed a special Wi-Fi Protected Setup button on the device.
 The router acts as a registrar for the network, although other devices may act as a registrar as well.

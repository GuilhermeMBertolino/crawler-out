Description:  Avahi is an mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf) 
 implementation (library). It facilitates 
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that 
 you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, 
 find printers to print to or find files being shared.
 This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X
 (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 The libavahi package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries,
 used by other programs. Specifically, it provides
 libavahi-core and libavahi-common libraries.
 By default, it is built without D-Bus support,
 i.e. the --disable-dbus configuration flag is set.
 To enable D-Bus support, select the package
 libavahi-dbus-support.

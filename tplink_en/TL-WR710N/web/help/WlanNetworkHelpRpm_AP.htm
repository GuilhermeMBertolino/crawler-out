<H1>Wireless Settings Help</H1>
<p><B>Note</B>: The operating distance or range of your wireless connection varies significantly based on the physical placement of the AP. For best results, place your AP</P>

<ul>
<lI>Near the center of the area in which your wireless stations will operate.</lI>
<lI>In an elevated location such as a high shelf.</lI>
<lI>Away from the potential sources of interference, such as PCs, microwaves, 
and cordless phones.</lI>
<lI>With the Antenna in the upright position.</lI>
<lI>Away from large metal surfaces.</lI>
</ul>

<p><B>Note</B>: Failure to follow these guidelines can result in significant performance degradation or inability to wirelessly connect to the AP.</p>
<p><B>Operation Mode</B> - Several Operation Modes are supported, including: (1)Access Point (2)Multi-SSID (3)Client (4)WDS Repeater (5)Universal Repeater (6)Bridge with AP. The available setting options are different in various operation modes, and they are explained below.</p>

<p><B>Access Point</B> - This operation mode allows wireless stations to access.</p>
<p><B>Multi-SSID</B> - AP can support up to 4 SSID. </p>
<ul>
<lI><B>Enable VLAN</B> - Check this box to enable the VLAN function. The AP supports up to 4 VLANs. All wireless PCs in the VLANs are able to access this AP. The AP can also work with an IEEE 802.1Q Tag VLAN supporting Switch. If this Switch enables the Tag VLAN function, besides all wireless PCs, only the PCs in the VLAN same with SSID1 are able to access the AP. If a PC is directly connected to the LAN port of the AP, please make sure that its adapter supports Tag function, or this PC will not be able to access the AP.</lI>	
<lI><B>SSID</B> - Enter a value of up to 32 characters. The same Name (SSID) must be assigned to all wireless devices in your network. In Multi-SSID operation mode,  enter SSID for each BSS in the field "SSID1" ~ "SSID4".</lI>
<lI><B>VLAN ID</B> - The ID of a VLAN. Only in the same VLAN, can a Wireless PC and a wired PC communicate with each other. The value can be between 1 and 4095. If the VLAN function is enabled, when AP forwards packets, the packets out from the LAN port will be added with an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN Tag, whose VLAN ID is just the ID of the VLAN where the sender belongs.</lI>
<lI><strong>Region</strong> - Select your region from the pull-down list. This field specifies the region where the wireless function of the AP can be used. It may be illegal to use the wireless function of the AP in a region other than one of those specified in this filed. If your country or region is not listed, please contact your local government agency for assistance.</lI>
<lI><B>Channel</B> - This field determines which operating frequency will be used. It is not necessary to change the wireless channel unless you notice interference problems with another nearby access point. </lI>
<lI><B>Mode</B> -This field determines the wireless mode which the AP works on.</lI>
<lI><B>Channel Width</B> - The bandwidth of the wireless channel.</lI>
<lI><B>Max Tx Rate</B> - You can limit the maximum tx rate of the AP through this field.</lI>
<lI><B>Enable Wireless Radio</B> - The wireless radio of the AP can 
be enabled or disabled to allow or deny wireless stations to access. If enabled, the wireless 
stations will be able to access the AP, otherwise, wireless stations will 
not be able to access the AP.</lI>
<lI><B>Enable SSID Broadcast</B> - If you select the <B>Enable SSID Broadcast</B> 
checkbox, the AP will broadcast its name (SSID) on the air. </lI>
</ul>

<p><B>Client</B> - This device will act as a wireless station to enable wired host(s) to access AP.</p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Enable WDS</b> - The AP client can connect to AP with WDS enabled or
disabled. If WDS is enabled, all traffic from wired networks will be forwarded
in the format of WDS frames consisting of four address fields. If WDS is
disabled, three address frames are used. If your AP supports WDS well,
please enable this option.</LI>
<LI><b>Wireless Name of Root AP</b> - Enter the SSID of AP that you want to access.</LI>
<LI><b>MAC Address of Root AP</b> - Enter the MAC address of AP that you want to access.</LI>
</UL>
<p><B>WDS Repeater</B> - In WDS Repeater mode, the AP with WDS enabled will relay data to an associated root AP. AP function is enabled meanwhile. The wireless repeater relays signal between its stations and the root AP for greater wireless range. Please input the MAC address of root AP in the field <B>"MAC Address of Root AP"</B>.</p>
<p><B>Universal Repeater</B> - In Universal Repeater mode, the AP with WDS disabled will relay data to an associated root AP. AP function is enabled meanwhile. The wireless repeater relays signal between its stations and the root AP for greater wireless range. Please input the MAC address of root AP in the field <B>"MAC Address of Root AP"</B>.</p>
<p><B>Bridge with AP</B> - In Bridge with AP mode, this device can be used to combine multiple local networks in distant hard-to-wire distant together to the same one via wireless connections. While bridging with other APs, this device can also act as an access point at the same time to create a local wireless network for all Wi-Fi devices.</p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Wireless Name of Remote AP</B> - The ssid of the AP your device is going to connect to as a client.
You can also use the search function to select the ssid to join.</LI>
<LI><B>MAC Address of Remote AP</B> - The bssid of the AP your device is going to connect to as a client.
You can also use the search function to select the bssid to join.</LI>
<LI><B>Survey</B> - Click this button, you can search the AP which runs in the current channel.</LI>
<LI><B>Key type</B> - This option should be chosen according to the AP's security configuration.It is recommended that the security type is the same as your AP's security type.</LI>
<LI><B>Auth Type</B> - This option indicates the authorization type of the Root AP.</LI>
<LI><B>Key Format</B> - You can select <B>ASCII</B> or <B>Hexadecimal</B> format. ASCII Format stands for any combination of keyboard characters in the specified length. Hexadecimal format stands for any combination of hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f, A-F) in the specified length.</LI>
<LI><B>WEP Index</B> - This option should be chosen if the key type is WEP(ASCII) or WEP(HEX).It indicates the index of the WEP key.</LI>
<LI><B>Password</B> - If the AP your Router is going to connect needs password, you need to fill the password in this blank.</LI>
</UL>
<p style="display:none"><B>Bridge with AP</B> - This operation mode bridges the AP and up to 4 APs also in bridge mode to connect two or more wired LANs. Please input the MAC address of other APs in the field <B>"MAC of AP1"</B> to <B>"MAC of AP4"</B>. AP function will also startup.</p>

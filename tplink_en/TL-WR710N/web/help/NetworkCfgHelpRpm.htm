<lI><B>Static IP</B> - In this type, you can configure IP Address/Gateway manually.</lI>
<lI><B>Smart IP(DHCP)</B> - The router will determine whether to enable the DHCP Server of itself automatically. We strongly recommend this type.</lI>

<lI><B>Subnet Mask</B> - An address code that determines the size of the network. Usually it is 255.255.255.0. </lI>

</ul>

<p><B>Note: </B></p>
<ol type=1>
<LI>If you change the LAN IP address, you must use the new IP address to login to the Router.</LI>
<LI>If the new LAN IP address you set is not in the same subnet with the previous one, the IP Address pool in the DHCP server will be configured automatically, but the Virtual Server and DMZ Host will not take effect until they are re-configured</LI>
<LI>You can enable or disable IGMP Proxy. This feature is enabled by default.</LI>

Description:  Avahi is an mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf) 
 implementation (library). It facilitates 
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that 
 you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, 
 find printers to print to or find files being shared.
 This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X
 (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 This package contains a Unicast DNS server from mDNS/DNS-SD configuration
 daemon, which may be used to configure conventional DNS servers using mDNS
 in a DHCP-like fashion. Especially useful on IPv6.

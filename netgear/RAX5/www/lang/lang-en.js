Otherwise, click <b>No</b>. </p><p><b>Note: </b>If you have installed PPP software such as WinPoET (from Earthlink) or Enternet (from PacBell), then you have PPPoE. Select <b>Yes</b>. After selecting Yes and configuring your router, you will not need to run the PPP software on your PC to connect to the Internet. </p><a name=isp></a><h2 class=helpfile>Internet Service Provider</h2><p>Select the service provided by your ISP. <b>PPPoE</b> is the most common. <b>PPTP</b> is used in Austria and other European countries. <b>L2TP</b> is used in Russia, Israel, and not common in other countries.</p><a name=login></a><h2 class=helpfile>Login </h2><p>This is usually the name that you use in your e-mail address. For example, if your main mail account isJerAB@ISP.com, then put JerAB in this field. </p><p>Some ISPs (like Mindspring, Earthlink, and T-DSL) require that you use your full e-mail address when you log in. If your ISP requires your full e-mail address, then type it in the <b>Login</b> field. </p><a name=password></a><h2 class=helpfile>Password</h2><p>Type the password that you use to log in to your ISP. </p><a name=conn_mode></a><h2 class=helpfile>Connection Mode</h2><p>Set the Connection Mode to Dial on Demand, Always On, or Manually Connect.<br>With the default setting, Dial on Demand, a PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP connection automatically starts when there is outbound traffic to the Internet, and it automatically terminates if the connection is idle based on the value in the Idle Timeout setting. When the Connection Mode is set to Always On, the PPPoE/PPTP/L2TP connection automatically starts when the computer boots up, but the connection does not time out. The router will keep trying to bring up the connection if it is disconnected for some reason.If you select Manually Connect, you must go to the Router Status screen and click the Connect button in order to connect to the Internet. The manual connection does not time out and you have to click the Disconnect button on the Router Status screen to disconnect it.</p><a name=idletime></a><h2 class=helpfile>Idle Time-out</h2><p>An idle Internet connection will be terminated after this time period.<p>If this value is zero (0), then the connection will be kept alive ,the connection will be reestablished immediately whenever the connection is lost.</p><a name=myip></a><h2 class=helpfile>My IP Address</h2><p>If your ISP gave you a fixed IP address, such as 10.0.0.140, enter it here. Otherwise, leave this field blank. You can then be allocated an IP address automatically when you connect.</p><a name=serverip></a><h2 class=helpfile>Server IP Address</h2><p>If your ISP gave you the IP address of your ISP&apos;s server, such as 10.0.0.138, enter it here. If your ISP gave you a domain name of the server, such as vpn.corbina.net, you can enter the name here.</p><h2 class=helpfile>Gateway IP Address</h2><p>If you have a fixed (or static) IP address for <b>My IP Address</b>, your ISP should have also provided you with a gateway IP address. You need to enter the gateway IP address here. If you use DHCP client to get My IP Address, or your service provider requires you to leave <b>My IP Address</b> blank, there is no need to enter a gateway IP address. </p><a name=id></a><h2 class=helpfile>Connection ID/Name</h2><p>Most of the time the <b>ID/Name</b> field should be left blank. However, if your ISP provided you one, enter the connection ID here.</p><a name=DNSaddress></a><h2 class=helpfile>Domain Name Server (DNS) Address </h2><p>The DNS server is used to look up site addresses based on their names. </p><p>If your ISP gave you one or two DNS addresses, select <b>Use These DNS Servers</b>, and type the primary and secondary addresses. </p><p>Otherwise, select <b>Get Automatically from ISP</b>. </p><p><b>Note: </b>If you get Address not found errors when you go to a website, it is likely that your DNS servers are not set up correctly. You should contact your ISP to get DNS server addresses. </p><h2 class=helpfile><a name=localaddress></a>Router MAC Address </h2><p>Each computer or router on your network has a unique 48-bit local Ethernet address. This is also referred to as the computer&apos;s MAC (Media Access Control) address. </p><p>Usually, select <b>Use Default Address</b>.</p><p>If your ISP requires MAC authentication, then select either <b>Use Computer MAC Address</b> to have the router use the MAC address of the computer you are now using, or <b>Use This MAC Address</b>, and manually type in the MAC address that your ISP expects.</p> <p>The format for the MAC address is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. If you select <b>Use This MAC Address</b> and type in a MAC address, do not select <b>Use This Computer&apos;s MAC Address</b> or your entry will be overwritten.</p><h2 class=helpfile><a name=buttons> </a>Apply, Cancel, and Test Buttons</h2><p>Click <b>Apply</b> when you finish changing the settings. </p><p>Click <b>Cancel</b> to return to the previous settings. </p><p>Click <b>Test</b> to connect to the NETGEAR website.

"plex_026" : "<p><font size=4><b>Plex Media Server Help</b></font></p><a name=ip_tag></a><p>Plex Media Server manages your music, video, and photos that are stored on a locally attached USB storage drive, and streams these media files to your devices, such as desktop computers, mobile phones, and tablets.</p><p>These devices can be connected to your router remotely or locally. To connect to your router locally, use a wired Ethernet connection or WiFi connection.</p><p>Plex Media Server is enabled by default. However, you can disable it if you do not want to use it.</p><p>If Plex does not detect that a USB storage drive is attached to the router, Plex is unavailable until a drive is attached.</p><p>If multiple USB storage drives are attached, you can designate one USB drive for use by the Plex Media Server to store and keep the media files and their associated metadata files.</p><p>The router periodically checks for new Plex binary version updates when new features or bug fixes are available. If a new version is found, you must log in to the router and manually update the Plex Media Server to the new version.</p><p>If you enable the automatic update, when a new binary version update is available, the router automatically performs the update at 3:00 a.m. This allows for fewer disruptions while you are streaming media during other hours.</p><p>Note that Plex Media Server restarts after the new version update or after the USB storage drive is changed.</p><p>Your router supports a NAS-based local network drive using the Samba protocol for the Plex media libraries. Follow the router GUI to add a network connection. The connection displays on the Plex Media Server page. Check with your network drive manufacturer for instructions about sharing a folder to other network devices.</p><p>You must use a USB 3.0 storage device for Plex metadata and configuration files. The USB storage device must have at least 5 GB of space.</p>",
